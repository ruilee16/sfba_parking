## San Francisco Bay Area Parking Inventory Study
### SFBA Parking Code Database
A [parking code database](/parking_code.json) of residential and non-residential off-street parking was developed by cross-referencing regional land parcel data with municipal off-street [parking requirements database](/ParkingRequirementsbyCity.html).
